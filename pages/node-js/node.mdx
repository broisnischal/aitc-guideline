# Backend Development Guidelines

## Naming Conventions

### Variables

- Use nouns or adjectives and camelCase (e.g. `roleName`)
- Minimize use of abbreviations  
- Avoid one-character names like 'o', 'p', 'q'
- Use descriptive boolean variable names (e.g. `isDeleted`) 
- Be self-descriptive to enhance clarity and maintainability

### Constants 

- Use UPPERCASE with underscores (e.g. `CLIENT_URL`) 
- Indicates immutability

## Request Path

- Use nouns instead of verbs (e.g. `/orders` not `/getOrders`)
- Be clear, descriptive and reflect resource purpose  
- Simple names with hyphens or underscores
- Include version number (e.g. `/v1/resource`)

## Folder Structure

- Separate code into appropriate layers following Model-Controller-Service pattern
- Have routes, handlers, and middlewares

## Component Organization

- One file per component/class/interface with matching name

## Configuration Management 

- Keep sensitive data in separate config files and `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables

## Versioning

- Include version in URL for backward compatibility  

## Database Integration

- Don't directly include user input in queries
- Use ORM like Sequelize or Mongoose

## Logging

- Use libraries like Winston or Morgan 

## Status Codes

- Follow convention:
  - `200` for success
  - `201` for creation  
  - `204` for success but no response 
  - `400` for bad request
  - Error codes for authentication issues, forbidden access, resource not found

## Security 

- Use SSL/TLS encryption
- Input validation and data sanitization 
- Rate limiting 
- Token based authentication (OAUTH2)
- User roles and permissions  

## Error Handling

- Descriptive messages
- Use JSON with proper status codes
- Server-side logging

## Pagination/Filtering/Searching/Sorting

- Always use `page` and `limit ` params 
- Use `filter` param to filter data
- Use `q` param to search data  
- Sort data in GET requests

## Other Guidelines

- Comments for complex logic  
- Consistent JSON request/response
- Implement CORS  
- Unit, integration, end-to-end testing
- Rate limiting
